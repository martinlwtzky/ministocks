This fork targets advanced notification features
- main future direction: bridged wear activity displaying selected stock information (as the widgets do)
- currently issues a notification when high/low limits are crossed, including vibration. 
- should fix https://github.com/niteshpatel/ministocks/issues/44 (at least does for German locale)
- currently requires api-level 16 (Android 4.1 JellyBean, 95,2% as of today).
- good Wear support comes with api-level 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop, 40,5% as of today). 

Any new features will be targeted at api-level 10 (Android 2.3.3)
